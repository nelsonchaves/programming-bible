# Callbacks

https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_callbacks.html

- Callbacks allow you to trigger logic before or after an alteration of an object's state.
- Callbacks are methods that get called at certain moments of an object's life cycle.
- With callbacks it is possible to write code that will run whenever an Active Record object is created, saved, updated, deleted, validated, or loaded from the database.
