# Terminal Commands

The mkdir command stands for Make Directory. Here we are creating a directory on my Desktop called neptune.

```zsh
mkdir neptune
```

We can create multiple directories using the -p option.

```zsh
mkdir -p space/neptune
```

In your terminal to find out the PID of the process:
```zsh
lsof -wni tcp:3000
```
Use the number in the PID column to kill the process:
```zsh
kill -9 <PID>
```
