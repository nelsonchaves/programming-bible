### Implementing Internationalization (i18n) in Rails with YML

Rails provides robust support for internationalization (i18n), allowing you to manage multilingual content in your application with ease. Here's how you can implement and enhance i18n using YML:

#### Basic Translation in Views

In your views, use the `translate` (or its alias `t`) method to fetch translated strings. For instance, in `app/views/site/index.html.erb`:

```ruby
# Fetching translated strings in a view
= translate(".heading")
= translate(".form_footer", year: Date.current.year)
```

#### Handling Form Submissions

For form submissions, you can omit the label for the submit button and pass `nil` as the first argument:

```ruby
# Omitting the label for a form submit button
= f.submit nil, class: "button"
```

#### Setting Up Translations with YML

Translations are defined in YML files within the `config/locales` directory. Here's an example for English (`en.yml`):

```yaml
# Locale configuration in en.yml
en:
  helpers:
    label:
      username: "User name"
      password: "Secret password"
    submit:
      submit: "Send it!"
  site:
    index:
      heading: "Hello World"
      form_footer: "Â© %{year}"
```

#### Adding a New Language

To add a new language, create a corresponding YML file, such as `portuguese.yml`, in the same directory.

#### Configuring the Default Locale

Set the default locale globally in `app/config/application.rb`. This sets the entire application's default language:

```ruby
# Setting the default locale
config.i18n.default_locale = :portuguese
```

#### Handling Multiple Languages

If your Rails app needs to serve multiple languages simultaneously, setting the locale in the controller is a more dynamic approach:

```ruby
# Setting the locale in a controller
def index
  locale = params[:locale] || I18n.default_locale
  I18n.locale = locale
end
```

#### User-Friendly Language Switching

To enhance user experience, add clickable links for language switching:

```ruby
# Links for language switching
= link_to t(".english"), root_path(locale: :english)
= link_to t(".portuguese"), root_path(locale: :portuguese)
```

With these links, users can easily switch the page language by clicking on them, which will set the appropriate locale parameter.
