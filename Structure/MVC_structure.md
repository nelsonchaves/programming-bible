### Simplified Explanation of Ruby on Rails MVC Structure

Ruby on Rails uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to organize code and separate concerns. Here's a straightforward breakdown:

#### Model

- **Purpose:** The Model primarily deals with data: it handles storing, retrieving, and processing application data.
- **Data Handling:** It contains the application's data, usually stored in a database (though not always).
- **Business Logic:** The Model manages business logic related to the data. It's important to include only data-related logic here, not all business logic.
- **Controller Interaction:** The Model provides data to the Controller but has no direct interaction or knowledge of the View.

#### View

- **Role:** The View is responsible for presenting data to the user. It builds the user interface.
- **Data Access:** The View accesses data passed to it from the Controller through instance variables.
- **User Interface:** As the user interface, the View constructs the pages or screens the user interacts with.
- **Independence:** The View does not directly interact with the Model; it only uses data provided by the Controller.

#### Controller

- **Functionality:** The Controller acts as the intermediary between the user (browser) and the application (Model and View).
- **Data Flow:** It fetches data from the Model and passes this data to the View.
- **Request Handling:** The Controller receives and handles requests from the browser.
- **Response Generation:** After processing data and interactions, the Controller sends the response back to the browser.
- **Coordination:** The Controller orchestrates the flow of data between the Model and the View.

In summary, in a Rails application, the Model handles data and logic related to that data, the View presents data and interfaces with the user, and the Controller manages the flow of data between the Model and the View, responding to user inputs. This separation helps keep the code organized, clear, and maintainable.
